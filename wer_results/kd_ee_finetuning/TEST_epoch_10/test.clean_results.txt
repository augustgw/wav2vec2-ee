	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12: 

file: 8230-279154-0019.flac

	layer_12: 

file: 8230-279154-0025.flac
expected: we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy

expected: to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10:

	layer_8:

	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

expected: so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

expected: the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12: 

file: 3570-5695-0012.flac
expected: it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest

	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12: 

file: 3570-5696-0001.flac
expected: but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture

expected: a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10:

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:

	layer_6: 
	layer_8: 
	layer_10: 
	layer_12:
